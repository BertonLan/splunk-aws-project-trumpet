### v0.1 - 01/10/2019

* Additional data sources have been added to the trumpet configuration tool. These include AWS VPC Flow logs, custom AWS CloudWatch Log groups, and **all** AWS data sources available through AWS CloudWatch Events (This includes AWS GuardDuty Findings, AWS Macie Alerts, AWS Health Events, etc.).
* For full functionality, trumpet now only requires two HTTP Event Collector (HEC) tokens to be created. One with indexer acknowledgement enabled, and one without (this token is only used if you choose to configure sending AWS Config data), all other token attributes (source, sourcetype, etc.) are not used and will be overridden.
* All data sources from AWS Kinesis Firehose will use the same HEC token when sending data to Splunk and send to the event endpoint. Sourcetype and other internal field assignment is set by a transforming function. Transforming Lambda functions for VPC Flow logs, CloudWatch logs, and CloudWatch Events have been added to this release to support this functionality.
* Automated HTTP Event Collector (HEC) token creation architecture has changed. This step has moved to the generated AWS CloudFormation template. **A major drawback of this approach is that the provided Splunk password will be included in plaintext in the custom CloudFormation template.** This approach should **only** be used for prototype trumpet deployments on **non-production** environments, otherwise, manually create the tokens in Splunk prior to configuring trumpet.
